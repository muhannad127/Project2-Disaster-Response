# Project2-Disaster-Response

## Summary

A data scientist needs to have a good understanding of data engineering techniques and know how to build pipelines that start with processing raw data. This data needs to be manipulated and cleaned before it is fed to a machine learning model.

Hence, the purpose of this project is to create ETL and machine learning pipelines. The outcome of these pipelines is a model that categorizes messages based on predefined categories. 

A web application is then created to host the model, where a user can type in a message and then see the category of that message.
The web application also hosts graphs that explore the dataset

## Installations

The project was completed using the Project Workspace IDE. There were two modifications on the environment to make the code work: These packages were added

* pandas==1.0.3
* scikit-learn==0.22.2

Use the following commands to install:

```
pip install pandas==1.0.3
```
Or

```
conda install pandas=1.0.3
```


```
pip install -U scikit-learn
```
Or

```
conda install scikit-learn=0.22.2
```

## File Descriptions

Each question is pursued in a seperate notebook for order and easy navigation. they are conveniently named: 

* Q1.ipynb 
* Q2.ipynb 
* Q3.ipynb

The notebooks contain the methods utilized for answering the questions as well as stats and data visualizations
